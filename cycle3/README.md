Cycle 3
=======
In this version, we:
- Pull out components into their own .js files; and
- Add imports and default exports


Instructions to create the rest of the app structure:
----------------------------------------------------

Before writing any new code, we did:

(1) sudo npm install --global create-react-app
(2) create-react-app cycle3



And when it was all done, to build a minified, optimized version of the app for upload:
(3) npm run build
